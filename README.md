# PriSecDBAPI SDK/CLI
This repository will be responsible in creating SDK or CLI for PriSecDBAPI as these SDK or CLI will be consumed by client side.

I'll only be publishing SDK/CLI if and only PriSecDBAPI and PriSecDBClientPanel are **matured/stable**.

It's uncertain whether I could create an SDK or CLI as I could use only C# to create them.

It's also uncertain whether the final SDK/CLI can be consumed in low code or no code environment.

If it could be used in low code or no code environment, it also possess some critical issues which are including but not limited to **Environmental factors(security)**,**Language interoperability(programmer/coder's niche and hard skills)**.
